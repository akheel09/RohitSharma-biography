    <p>Rohit Gurunath Sharma was born in a modest household in Bansod, a locality in Nagpur, Maharashtra. His father worked as a caretaker in a transport company and earned a limited income that made it difficult to support the family. Due to these financial constraints, Rohit was sent to live with his grandparents in Borivali, Mumbai. It was here that his journey with cricket began.

From a young age, Rohit displayed a natural flair for sports. He would often play cricket with local kids in the lanes of Borivali using tennis balls and makeshift bats. Observing his enthusiasm and skill, his uncle decided to support his cricketing dreams by enrolling him in a cricket academy.

At the age of 11, he joined a coaching camp run by Dinesh Lad, a well-known cricket coach in Mumbai. Dinesh Lad saw something special in the boy and decided to take a personal interest in his development. Realizing that Rohit needed better opportunities, Lad arranged for him to transfer to Swami Vivekanand International School, where he had access to proper training and a cricket ground.

Initially, Rohit started as an off-spinner, but during one practice session, Lad asked him to open the innings due to the absence of a regular player. Rohit scored a century in that match, and from there, there was no looking back. His batting was characterized by elegance, timing, and a calm temperament far beyond his age.
He quickly rose through the school cricket circuit and made a name for himself in Mumbai cricket circles. Despite struggling financially, he never allowed his circumstances to limit his ambition. The support from his coach and uncle played a crucial role in shaping his early career.

His dedication and performances earned him selection in the Under-17 and Under-19 Mumbai teams. As he began to build a reputation for big scores and stylish stroke play, national selectors took notice. It was clear that Rohit Sharma was not just another aspiring cricketer — he was someone destined for greatness.

<p>Rohit Sharma's cricketing career took flight when he made his debut in domestic cricket for West Zone during the Deodhar Trophy in 2005. He gained national attention in a match against North Zone, where he scored a blistering 142 runs off 123 balls. This performance helped him break into the Indian A squad and soon after, into the senior Indian team.

He made his international debut for India in an ODI against Ireland on June 23, 2007. Although he didn’t get to bat in that match, his breakthrough came in the 2007 ICC World T20 in South Africa. His unbeaten 50 against South Africa and composed innings in the final against Pakistan earned him recognition as a player for the future.

Initially, Rohit struggled with consistency, and his place in the team was not always secure. However, the turning point in his career came in 2013 when then-captain MS Dhoni asked him to open the innings. This decision transformed Rohit's career. In his very first series as an opener, he formed a formidable partnership with Shikhar Dhawan in the Champions Trophy, leading India to victory.

Later that year, he scored his first double century in ODIs — 209 against Australia. It was followed by 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014, the highest individual score in ODI history. He then added a third double century to his tally in 2017, further cementing his status as one of the greatest white-ball openers
Rohit’s Test career took time to flourish. He made his debut in 2013 with back-to-back centuries but was in and out of the squad. In 2019, he was promoted to opener in Tests, and he responded with a century in both innings of his first match as opener. Since then, he has been a vital cog in India’s red-ball setup.

He was named India’s full-time white-ball captain in 2021 and became Test captain in 2022. Under his leadership, India has remained one of the top cricketing sides globally.

In the Indian Premier League, Rohit has been a legend. He has led the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles, the most by any captain. His calm and tactical mindset makes him a natural leader on the field.He continues to be a regular feature in the ICC rankings for top ODI and T20I batsmen, often competing with the likes of Babar Azam and Virat Kohli.

In 2024, he reached the milestone of 15000 international runs, making him one of the top run-getters in the modern era.

With more milestones still ahead, Rohit Sharma continues to be a symbol of elegance, power, consistency, and leadership — the perfect combination that makes him a modern cricketing legend.

<h2 id="achievements">Achievements and Awards</h2>
<p>Rohit Sharma's cricketing journey is etched in golden letters in the history of the sport. Known as "The Hitman" for his explosive batting and effortless stroke play, Rohit has achieved milestones that most players only dream of. His career is decorated with records, awards, and match-winning performances across all formats of the game.

Rohit is the only player in the world to have scored three double centuries in One Day Internationals (ODIs). His scores of 209, 264, and 208* are iconic, with the 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens being the highest individual score in ODI history. This record has remained untouched since 2014.

He was the first player to score five centuries in a single World Cup, accomplishing this feat during the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. He ended the tournament as the highest run-scorer, further solidifying his status as one of the greatest ODI batsmen of all time.

Rohit holds the record for the most hundreds in T20 Internationals, with 5 centuries. He became the first cricketer to score four T20I centuries, and later extended it to five, a record unmatched by any other international player.

He is the only Indian cricketer to score a T20I century as a captain, and he achieved this in just 35 balls — one of the fastest T20I centuries in history.

In Test cricket, Rohit Sharma made history by scoring twin centuries (one in each innings) in his debut series as an opener, against South Africa in 2019. He scored 176 and 127, showcasing his adaptability and class in the red-ball format.

He has scored centuries in all three formats of international cricket — Tests, ODIs, and T20Is — a testament to his versatility and skill across conditions and oppositions.

Rohit has also hit the most sixes in a calendar year in international cricket, showcasing his explosive power-hitting ability. He broke AB de Villiers’ previous record and continues to dominate the stat every year.

As of now, he has over 10,000 ODI runs, a milestone achieved by only a handful of players in the history of the game. He achieved it faster than many legendary batters, including Brian Lara and Ricky Ponting.

In the Indian Premier League (IPL), Rohit Sharma is one of the most successful captains in history. He has led the Mumbai Indians to five IPL titles — in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. No other captain has led a team to more titles in the tournament's history.

He is also one of the few players to win six IPL trophies — five as a captain and one as a player with Deccan Chargers in 2009.

Rohit Sharma was awarded the Arjuna Award in 2015, one of India's highest sporting honors. It recognized his consistent performances and contribution to Indian cricket.

In 2020, he was honored with the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (now renamed as the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna), India’s highest sporting honor, making him only the fourth cricketer after Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, and Virat Kohli to receive the award.

He has been featured in ICC's ODI Team of the Year multiple times — 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 — and was named the ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2019.

Rohit holds the record for most centuries in ODIs against Australia by an Indian. He has scored several match-winning knocks against top sides, including Pakistan, South Africa, and England.

He is also the only player to have scored five or more centuries in ODI bilateral series — a feat he achieved against Sri Lanka.

He has the unique record of scoring a century in all three formats at a single venue — Eden Gardens, Kolkata — one of the most iconic cricket grounds in the world.

Rohit is known for his incredible consistency. He averages over 50 in ODIs and has maintained a healthy average in both Tests and T20Is, despite the varying demands of each format.

He has hit more than 500 international sixes, making him one of the most powerful hitters in world cricket. His clean hitting ability, especially down the ground and over midwicket, is admired by fans and cricketers alike.

Rohit was a part of the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup-winning team, playing a crucial role in India's victory. His 50* against South Africa in the group stage was vital in taking India into the semifinals.

He also played a major role in India’s Asia Cup victories — including leading the team in Virat Kohli’s absence in 2018 and lifting the trophy.

In 2023, he captained India in the World Test Championship Final and has consistently led India to the top of the ICC Test rankings during his leadership tenure.

He is known for his calmness under pressure and excellent tactical acumen as a leader. Under his captaincy, India has won crucial series both at home and overseas.

Rohit is one of the few cricketers to score a century in his maiden World Cup match — he scored 122* against South Africa in the 2019 World Cup opener.

He has also scored centuries in all ICC tournaments — the World Cup, Champions Trophy, and T20 World Cup — showcasing his ability to perform on the big stage.

As a fielder, he is sharp and reliable, especially in the slips and deep midwicket region. He has taken over 150 international catches, adding immense value as a utility player.

Beyond cricket, Rohit Sharma is also known for his work in wildlife conservation and animal welfare. He is the official rhino ambassador of WWF-India and often speaks out on environmental issues.

He has been recognized as one of the most marketable athletes in India, featuring in endorsements, magazine covers, and advertisements due to his massive popularity.

Rohit is admired for his calm, composed, and humble personality, often credited for keeping dressing room morale high and mentoring younger players like Shubman Gill, Ishan Kishan, and others.

In terms of leadership, he is only the second Indian captain after MS Dhoni to win an IPL title, and the only one to win it five times.

His name is featured in the MCC’s list of players to watch, and he is often regarded as the most technically gifted Indian batsman after Sachin Tendulkar.

He was also part of the ICC Champions Trophy-winning team in 2013, opening the innings and forming a key partnership with Shikhar Dhawan.

Rohit has remained injury-free for most of his career, showcasing a high level of fitness and discipline, something he rarely gets credit for but is critical to his longevity.
